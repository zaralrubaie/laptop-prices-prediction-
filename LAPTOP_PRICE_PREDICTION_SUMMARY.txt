Project Description:
This project predicts laptop prices based on various features such as
company, product type, CPU details, RAM, screen resolution, storage,
and GPU information. The data preprocessing pipeline includes feature
engineering, handling skewness, and encoding categorical variables.
The model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure
robustness.
