# Laptop Price Prediction Using Pandas
This project predicts laptop prices based on various features using Python and Pandas. It demonstrates a complete workflow: data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The goal is to understand what drives laptop prices and build a model that can predict prices for new laptops.

## Project Description:
This project predicts laptop prices based on various features such as
company, product type, CPU details, RAM, screen resolution, storage,
and GPU information. The data preprocessing pipeline includes feature
engineering, handling skewness, and encoding categorical variables.
The model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure
robustness.
